ABC Corp is a mid-sized insurer in the US and in the recent past their fraudulent claims have increased
significantly for their personal auto insurance portfolio. They have developed a ML based predictive model to
identify propensity of fraudulent claims. Now, they assign highly experienced claim adjusters for top 5
percentile of claims identified by the model.
Your objective is to identify the top 5 percentile of claims from each state. Your output should be policy
number, state, claim cost, and fraud score.
