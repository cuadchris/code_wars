[Walmart SQL Interview Question]

This is the same question as problem #13 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given a table on Walmart user transactions. Based on their most recent transaction date, write a query that retrieve the users along with the number of products they bought.

Output the user's most recent transaction date, user ID, and the number of products, sorted in chronological order by the transaction date.

Starting from November 10th, 2022, the official solution was updated, and the expected output of transaction date, number of users, and number of products was changed to the current expected output.

user_transactions Table:

| Column Name        | Type      |
|--------------------|-----------|
| product_id         | integer   |
| user_id            | integer   |
| spend              | decimal   |
| transaction_date   | timestamp |


user_transactions Example Input:

| product_id | user_id | spend | transaction_date      |
|------------|---------|-------|-----------------------|
| 3673       | 123     | 68.90 | 07/08/2022 12:00:00  |
| 9623       | 123     | 274.10| 07/08/2022 12:00:00  |
| 1467       | 115     | 19.90 | 07/08/2022 12:00:00  |
| 2513       | 159     | 25.00 | 07/08/2022 12:00:00  |
| 1452       | 159     | 74.50 | 07/10/2022 12:00:00  |


Example Output:

| transaction_date      | user_id | purchase_count |
|-----------------------|---------|----------------|
| 07/08/2022 12:00:00  | 115     | 1              |
| 07/08/2022 12:00:000 | 123     | 2              |
| 07/10/2022 12:00:00  | 159     | 1              |

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
